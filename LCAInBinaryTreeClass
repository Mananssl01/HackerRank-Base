//NOTE -> The LCA problem cn also be solved more efficiently by Dynamic Programming approach , also known a 'Binary Lifting'. The preprocessing time is O(nlgn) 
//for filling up the node-parent matrix and after that O(lgn time is taken). more details at - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lca-in-a-tree-using-binary-lifting-technique/
